## 📋 Quick Reference

### Essential Concepts Checklist
- [ ] Variables and data types
- [ ] Control flow (if-else, loops)
- [ ] Arrays and array operations
- [ ] Method creation and calling
- [ ] Class design and object creation
- [ ] Encapsulation (private fields, public methods)
- [ ] Constructor usage
- [ ] Object interactions
- [ ] Basic recursion
- [ ] Problem-solving approach

### Coding Standards Reference
```java
// Class naming: PascalCase
public class StudentManager { }

// Method naming: camelCase
public void calculateGrade() { }

// Variable naming: camelCase
private String firstName;

// Constants: UPPER_CASE
private static final int MAX_SIZE = 100;

// Proper encapsulation
private int value;
public int getValue() { return value; }
public void setValue(int value) { this.value = value; }
```

### Common Patterns Reference
```java
// Constructor overloading
public Person() { /* default */ }
public Person(String name) { /* with name */ }
public Person(String name, int age) { /* with name and age */ }

// Method overloading
public int add(int a, int b) { /* two integers */ }
public double add(double a, double b) { /* two doubles */ }
public int add(int[] numbers) { /* array of integers */ }

// Validation pattern
public void setAge(int age) {
    if (age >= 0 && age <= 150) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}

// Object interaction pattern
public boolean enrollStudent(Student student, Course course) {
    if (course.hasSpace() && student.canEnroll()) {
        course.addStudent(student);
        student.addCourse(course);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

## 🛠️ Tools and Setup

### Development Environment
1. **Java JDK 8+** - Download from Oracle or use OpenJDK
2. **Text Editor/IDE** - VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse
3. **Command Line** - For compiling and running Java programs

### Compilation and Execution
```bash
# Compile a Java file
javac ClassName.java

# Run the compiled class
java ClassName

# Compile all files in a directory
javac *.java

# Run with classpath
java -cp . ClassName
```

### Debugging Tips
1. Use `System.out.println()` for tracing execution
2. Check variable values at different points
3. Test methods individually before combining
4. Start with simple cases, then add complexity

## 📞 Getting Help

### When You're Stuck
1. **Read the error message carefully** - Java error messages are usually descriptive
2. **Check the documentation** - Review relevant sections
3. **Start with simpler examples** - Break complex problems down
4. **Use print statements** - Debug by printing variable values
5. **Review working examples** - Compare with provided code

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Compilation errors**: Check syntax, spelling, and semicolons
- **Runtime errors**: Check array bounds, null references
- **Logic errors**: Use debugging prints, trace through code manually
- **Design problems**: Review OOP principles, start with simpler design
